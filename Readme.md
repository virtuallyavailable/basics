## Python data types
Data types are the classification and categorization of data items. It tells us that what operations are performed on specific data. There are many types of data types like int, float, string, list, set, dictionary and tuple data types. 
## Python numbers
Python numbers consists of int, float and complex numbers. Number data types store numeric values.
## Type conversion
Convert object from one data type to another data type is called type conversion. There are two types of type conversion. Implicit and explicit type conversion.
## Random Number
A randint function is used for making random number. This function is describe in random module. It allows only int type values.
## Type Casting
The method of converting a data type of one variable to another to some other data type is called type casting.
## Strings
We can add alphabets, words or other characters in a string. String consist of single quotation marks and double quotation marks.
## Multiline strings
The strings that are used to write multiple lines are called multiple strings. A multiline string start and ends with a three single quotes and three double quotes.
## Looping through a string
We can use looping through a string when we want to perform an operation on each character in a string.We can use for loop and while loop. For loop is used when we know about starting and ending point. While loop is used when we don't know about condition or starting, ending point.
## String length
The total number of characters in a string is known as string length. We use can len() function to know the length of string
## Check string
If we want to check the presence of certain word or character in a string we use "in" keyword.
## Python slicing strings
If we have a large string and when we extract a small part of this string this process is known as slicing string.
## Negative indexing
Negative indexing start from the end of the string. It start from right to left. It start from -1.
## String upper case
If we want to show any number written in a capital letters then we use upper case string.
## String lower case
If we want to show any number written in a lower letters then we use lower case letters.
## Replace string
The method in which we replace one specific character with another character is known as replace string.
## Split string
Split string is used to split the string in the list form.
## String concatenation
Merging of two strings or two number of characters is called the process of string concatenation. 
## Escape characters
Escape characters are used to insert characters in a string and these characters are valid. It is represented bt backslash \
## Boolean values
Boolean values are used to show truth and false values.
## Arithmetic operations
Arithmetic operation is used for mathematical operations like addition, multiplicaton, and subtracion.
## Bitwise operations
These operators are used to compare binary numbers
## Relational operators
These operators are used to show comparison bttween values like one value is lesser or greater than other.
## Assigment operators
These are used to assign a value to a variable
## Identity operators
Identity operators are used to compare objects if these objects are same with the same location.
## Logical operators
Logical operators are used if we want to compare more than one condition. AND OR NOT operations are used in logical operators.
